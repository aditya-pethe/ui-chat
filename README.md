UI-Chat is a chatbot that generates user interface code based on conversational inputs. This means you can simply describe the interface you want, and the chatbot will generate the corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. The key features include:

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Describe the UI component you want, and the chatbot will generate the corresponding code.
- **Code Preview**: Instantly preview the code generated by the chatbot. The code can be modified manually as well.

## How it works

Under the hood, UI-chat uses gpt-4 to generate code based on user requests, and previews it in the browser. Basically, uichat takes in the client code state + user request, generates modified code. It does this using langchain, an open source library for building applications with large language models.  

Ui-chat is build with react.js, node.js, langchain.js for the LLM actions, and hosted on Azure.
