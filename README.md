# ui-chat


UI-Chat is a chatbot that generates user interface code based on conversational inputs. This means you can simply describe the interface you want, and the chatbot will generate the corresponding HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code

## Core Features

- **Interactive Chatbot**: Describe the UI component you want, and the chatbot will generate the corresponding code.
- **Code Preview**: Instantly preview the code generated by the chatbot. The code can be modified manually as well.


## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine.
- An API key from openai
  
## Getting Started

## How it works:

### Agent Logic

At the core of this project is a conversational agent capable of making changes
to the UI by conversing with the user - this can be broken down into a few steps.

- Getting user input / storing the conversation in buffer memory
- Creating a conversational agent with langchain, which has access to buffer memory and a toolkit
- Defining a custom toolkit in langchain for writing code previews

### Tool Design

- There are two forms of relevant user input: 1) User conversation, and 2) Code state.
- The chat agent will summarize user requests to the input tool. 
- The input tool will use the summarized requests, in tandem with the current code state, to rewrite html/css/js code
