When we have a path that is uninterrupted, meaning no forks happen at all, we
could store that differently, as an array, instead of a long series of Maps.

    {
    }

Add ['a'] → 1

    {
      'a': 1
    }

Add ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'] → 4

    {
      'a': {
        <dataSymbol>: 1,
        'b': <shortcut:['c', 'd'], 4>,
      }
    }
